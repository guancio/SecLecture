\begin{frame}{Human resource security}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Security of a system depends on the user behavior
    \item e.g. DB with 135 M users, top 100 passwords cover 6 M users
    \item e.g. users sharing passwords
    \item e.g. unattended workstations
    \item Users can represent information flows that are not
      constrained by software/hardware
    \item Business process and procedures
    \item These information can carry authentication tokens
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{How Social Engineers Work}
  
  \begin{quote}
The social engineer employs the same persuasive 
techniques the rest of us use every day. We take 
on roles. We try to build credibility. We call in 
reciprocal obligations. But the social engineer 
applies these techniques in a manipulative, 
deceptive, highly unethical manner, often to 
devastating effect.
  \end{quote}
Brad Sagan, social psychologist

\begin{frame}{What for?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Industrial spying 
    \item Access to resources 
    \item Data theft
    \item Identity theft
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
 

\begin{frame}{Exploits}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The desire to help 
    \item Attribution
    \item Linking
    \item Fear
    \item Reactance (e.g. reverse psychology)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Social engineering is nothing new}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item In 1849, Samuel Williams, engineered gullible strangers out of
      their valuables simply by asking ``Have you confidence in me to
      trust me with your watch until tomorrow?''
    \item Joseph Weil ran a variety of scams, including conning Benito
      Mussollini out of 2 million USD by selling him phony rights to
      mining lands in Colorado
    \item Technology has made some kinds of fraud more difficult to
      commit
    \item It also created new opportunities for adaptable fraudsters
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Techniques: Trapping of roles}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Build a common enemy / being ally
    \item The devil-snake: genesis book, the snake convinces Eve that God was
      keeping his best power for himself, thus forbidding to eat from
      the ``Tree of Life''
    \item<2-> Today: call an enterprise and inform about the internal
      corporate restructuring
    \item<2-> The enterprise stakeholders the common enemy 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Read victim's openness/curiosity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Allow the victim to found a gift
    \item The trojan horse: Ulysses fooled the Trojans into believing
       his army had abandoned their siege by leaving a large
      wooden horse (full of soldiers) - a ``gift'' - outside the gates of the city
    \item<2-> Today: (Baiting) left a USB pen in the parking lot
    \item<2-> Today: left a DVD titled ``CVC recodring''
    \item<2-> Today: prepare an opened WiFi (at the airport) and dump the traffic
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: offer benefits}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Offer benefits to a victim to spread
    \item Ponzi scheme:  told friends if they invested with him, he
      would double their investment within 90 days. His scheme
      involved using new money to pay off older investors, and the
      entire business was being run at a loss
    \item Today: Bernie Madoff ($\$$ 65 billion, 10/30 years)
    \item<2-> Today: Bitcoins?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Credibility}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Look official, act official, people will believe you are official
    \item Frank Abagnale was able to
      convince Pan Am employees, and many others, that he was an
      airline pilot in the 1960, by dressing in a Pan Am pilot's uniform
    \item<2-> Today: (Attribution) during a phone call demostrate to know
      the organizational chart, to persuade the listener that you are
      an organizazion employee
    \item<2-> Today: (Attribution) use the exact lingo
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Techniques: Piggybacking}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item when a person tags along with
another person who is authorized to gain entry into a restricted area,
or pass a certain checkpoint.
    \item Following an individual authorized to enter
      a location, giving the appearance of being legitimately escorted
    \item Joining a large crowd authorized to enter, and pretending to
      be a member of the crowd that is largely unchecked
    \item \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=961XJLNoTcI}
    \item Countermeasure, use guards/two doors
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Techniques: Quid pro quo}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An attacker calls random numbers at a company, claiming to
      be calling back from technical support. Eventually this person
      will hit someone with a legitimate problem, grateful that
      someone is calling back to help them. The attacker will ``help''
      solve the problem and, in the process, have the user type
      commands that give the attacker access or launch malware.
    \item Create then fix a problem
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Phishing}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Fraudulently obtaining private information
    \item Sends an e-mail that appears to come from a legitimate
      business
    \item Request ``verification'' of information and warn of
      some dire consequence if it is not provided. 
    \item Link to a fraudulent web page that seems legitimate
    \item InteractiveVoceResponder or phone phishing
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other Techniques}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Distracting from systematic thinking
    \item Momentum of compliance
    \item Hide questions
    \item Get pieces from different sources
    \item Test with personal information
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples}

      Then you can reach me directly if you need to.
    \item[victim] That'd be great. Go ahead
    \item[\dots]
    \item[attacker] I need to check which port your computer is

      sticker somewhere that says something like ``Port Number''.
    \item Let Me Help You
    \item Disclosing a non-sensitive information
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Real case: the second call, two days later}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[IT Guy] Hi, this is Bob
    \item[attacker] I'm in Tom DeLay's office in
      Bookkeeping. We're trying to troubleshoot a cabling problem. I

      as soon as possible
    \item[\dots] (call to the IT to restore the network)
    \item Became an Ally
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Real case: the forth call}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item[attacker] Can you check the network?
    \item[victim] Great it works!!!
    \item[attacker] We still have firewall problems, if you want you

\begin{frame}{Anti-spam systems}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
      Computers and Humans Apart)
    \item In October 2013, artificial intelligence company Vicarious
      claimed that it had developed software that was able to solve
      modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to $90\%$
    \item<2-> Hire People To Solve CAPTCHA Challenges: 
set up a ``Turing Farm'' to
employ people to look at computer screens and answer CAPTCHA
challenges. 
\item<3-> ``Turing Porn/Warez Farm'', in which spammers also run a porn site that is
  gated by CAPTCHA challenges, which are actually ripped directly from
  the target service CAPTCHA
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Phases}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Pretexting
    \item Get data
    \item Keep connections
    \item Combine data
    \item Use it
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples: RSA}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2011 security breach in RSA
    \item two different phishing emails over a two-day period
    \item recipients two small groups of employees; not particularly
      high-profile or high-value targets
    \item subject line read ``2011 Recruitment Plan''
    \item The email was crafted well enough to trick one of the
      employees to retrieve it from their Junk mail folder
    \item and open the attached excel file
    \item the spreadsheet contained a zero-day exploit that installs a backdoor through an Adobe Flash vulnerability
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Examples: Associated Press Twitter hijack}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 2013 the Twitter account of the Associated Press reported\\
      ``Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama
      is injured.''
    \item It was false news. AP's Twitter account had been hijacked
    \item It had an immediate impact, the stock market dropped.
    \item Tweet 13:07, Dow Jones start do decrease 13:08, DJ $-1\%$
      13:10, 13:11 news began to spread that the tweet was erroneous
    \item Started with a phishing attack
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Countermeasure}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clear protocols that are enforced
    \item Awareness training
