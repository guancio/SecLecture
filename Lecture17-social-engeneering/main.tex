\begin{frame}{How Social Engineers Work}
  
  \begin{quote}
The social engineer employs the same persuasive 
techniques the rest of us use every day. We take 
on roles. We try to build credibility. We call in 
reciprocal obligations. But the social engineer 
applies these techniques in a manipulative, 
deceptive, highly unethical manner, often to 
devastating effect.

\begin{frame}{What for?}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Industrial spying 
    \item Access to resources 
    \item Data theft
    \item Identity theft
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
 

\begin{frame}{Exploits}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The desire to help 
    \item Attribution
    \item Linking
    \item Fear
    \item Reactance
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Trapping of roles}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item build a common enemy / being ally
    \item The devil-snake: genesis book, the snake convinces Eve that God was
      keeping his best power for himself, thus forbidding to eat from
      the ``Tree of Life''
    \item Today: call an enterprise and inform about the internal
      corporate restructuring
    \item The enterprise stakholders the common enemy 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Read victim's openness/curiosity}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item allow the victim to found a gift
    \item The trojan horse: Ulysses fooled the Trojans into believing
       his army had abandoned their siege by leaving a large
      wooden horse (full of soldiers) - a ``gift'' - outside the gates of the city
    \item Today: Baiting: left a USB pen in the parking lot
    \item Today: left a DVD titled ``CVC recodring''
    \item Today: build an opened WiFi (at the airport) and dump the traffic
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: offer benefits}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item offer benefits to a victim to spread to other victims
    \item Ponzi scheme:  told friends if they invested with him, he
      would double their investment within 90 days. His scheme
      involved using new money to pay off older investors, and the
      entire business was being run at a loss
    \item Today: Bernie Madoff
    \item Today: Bitcoins?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Techniques: Credibility}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Look official, act official, people will believe you are official
    \item Frank Abagnale who was able to
      convince Pan Am employees, and many others, that he was an
      airline pilot in the 1960, by dressing in a Pan Am pilot's uniform
    \item Today: 
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Techniques: Piggybacking}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item when a person tags along with
another person who is authorized to gain entry into a restricted area,
or pass a certain checkpoint.
    \item Surreptitiously following an individual authorized to enter
      a location, giving the appearance of being legitimately escorted
    \item Joining a large crowd authorized to enter, and pretending to
      be a member of the crowd that is largely unchecked
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Techniques: Quid pro quo}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item An attacker calls random numbers at a company, claiming to
      be calling back from technical support. Eventually this person
      will hit someone with a legitimate problem, grateful that
      someone is calling back to help them. The attacker will ``help''
      solve the problem and, in the process, have the user type
      commands that give the attacker access or launch malware.
    \item Create then fix a problem
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Other Techniques}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Distracting from systematic thinking
    \item Momentum of compliance
    \item Bury questions
    \item Get pieces from different sources
    \item Test with personal information
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Anti-spam systems}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell
      Computers and Humans Apart)
    \item In October 2013, artificial intelligence company Vicarious
      claimed that it had developed software that was able to solve
      modern CAPTCHAs with character recognition rates of up to $90\%$
    \item Hire People To Solve CAPTCHA Challenges: 
set up a ``Turing Farm'' to
employ people to look at computer screens and answer CAPTCHA
challenges. 
\item ``Turing Porn/Warez Farm'', in which spammers also run a porn site that is
  gated by CAPTCHA challenges, which are actually ripped directly from
  the target service CAPTCHA
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Phases}
